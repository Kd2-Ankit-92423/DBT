   4th column of the customers table is Rating.
3) What is another word for row?  For column? 
   Row -> Record, tuple, entity, opportunity.

4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table? 
   Because in the table, in RDBMS the rows are not stored sequentially or any specific order in the Database server Hard Disk, 
   In RDBMS, the rows are scattered/fragmented and stored wherever it finds the free space.
   but once the row is stored it's constant at that place.
   Therefore, there it is not possible to view the first five rows in RDBMS, you can do it in DBMS.
